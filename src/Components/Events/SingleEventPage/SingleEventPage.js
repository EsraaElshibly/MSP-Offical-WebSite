        And so we liked to leave the college and study department, and from the pure knowledge
        that we take from books, it alone will not be enough to support us after graduation,
        and from here was the beginning of our idea.
        How do we balance between the knowledge we have that we need after graduation ?! ...
        In order to deviate from the usual routine, the ExKnow Forum is not just a speaker
        explaining, and we hear or receive information, but, the EVENT is ...
        𝐏𝐚𝐧𝐞𝐥 𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐜𝐮𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧
        A discussion takes place between the attendees and the experts who are present with us,
        in order to make sure that they have really reached all your needs and answered all the questions.
        We gathered for you the most pioneering lecturers in their magazines, in order to pass
        on the experiences and experiences that they passed through during their lives to us.
        And these areas through which we linked technology to the skills and transactions that
        we need in order to start in the field with our own or even our own project, and the fields will be:
        <ul>
          <li> IOT</li>
          <li> Cloud Computing</li>
          <li> Software</li>
          <li> Banking</li>
          <li> Business</li>
          <li> Management</li>
        </ul>
        Since experience does not come only through experience, so it will remain among the most
        important paragraphs of our event. This is the (StartUps) paragraph.
        And the countries of the people who started their own projects, they started from scratch
        until they reached their idea of ​​light. They will talk to us about the challenges that I
        met and how they were able to overcome them.
        As you are used to from the huge opportunities that we provide, it had to be in a great
        place in order to be worthy of the ExKnow Forum.
        And so the most appropriate choice was the hall of the British University in Egypt.
